A few simple tasks solved with evolutionary algorithms


## The One-Max Problem

The goal is simply to find a bit vector (of some pre-determined length) containing all 1â€™s.


## The LOLZ Prefix Problem

The LOLZ Prefix problem is to maximize the number of leading ones (LO) or leading zeros (LZ) in a bit string.


## Surprising Sequences

Surprising sequences are those that are completely free of repeating patterns.
